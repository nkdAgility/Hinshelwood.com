Case studies document real client work with measurable outcomes. No theoretical examples. No sanitized success stories that hide the messy reality.

## Content Requirements

Every case study must include:
- **Client context**: Who they are, what they do (no need to name them if confidential)
- **The problem**: What wasn't working. Be specific. Quantify when possible.
- **What we did**: Concrete actions taken. Not "we aligned stakeholders" but "we ran 3 workshops with engineering and product teams to..."
- **The outcome**: Measurable results. Revenue impact, time saved, defects reduced, deployment frequency increased.
- **What didn't work**: Be honest about missteps and pivots. This builds credibility.

## Writing Standards

- Start with the outcome. Lead with the impact, not the backstory.
- Use real numbers. "Reduced deployment time by 60%" beats "significantly improved."
- Show your work. Explain the reasoning behind decisions.
- Avoid generic consulting speak. "We partnered to drive enablement" says nothing.
- Make it scannable. Use subheadings for each major section.

## Front Matter Requirements

```yaml
---
title: "Client Name or Problem Focus"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
description: "One sentence outcome"
tags: ["relevant", "tags"]
categories: ["case-studies"]
---
```

## Red Flags to Eliminate

- Claims without evidence
- Vague descriptions of work done
- Missing outcomes or results
- Overstating your role or impact
- Hiding the complexity or challenges

If you can't quantify the result, explain why and what qualitative indicators you tracked instead.
