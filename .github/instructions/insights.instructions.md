Insights are opinion pieces backed by experience. Take clear positions. Defend them. Don't hedge with "it depends" in every paragraph.

## Content Requirements

Every insight article must:
- **Take a stance**: Have a clear point of view
- **Support with evidence**: Personal experience, data, examples from the field
- **Address counterarguments**: Don't ignore obvious objections
- **Provide actionable takeaways**: Readers should know what to do with this information

## Structure

1. **Hook**: Open with a provocative statement, question, or real scenario (2-3 sentences)
2. **The problem**: What's wrong with current thinking or practice (1-2 paragraphs)
3. **Your position**: State your view clearly (1 paragraph)
4. **The case**: Build your argument with evidence and examples (3-5 paragraphs)
5. **Objections**: Address the strongest counterarguments (1-2 paragraphs)
6. **Action**: What should readers do with this (1 paragraph)

## Writing Standards

- Use "I" and "you." This is personal expertise, not a research paper.
- Cut unnecessary qualifiers. "Usually," "often," "tends to" weaken your point.
- Be specific. "Daily standups waste time" is better than "meetings can be inefficient."
- Use examples from real work. Anonymize if needed, but keep it concrete.
- Break up text. No paragraph longer than 5 lines.

## Front Matter Requirements

```yaml
---
title: "Clear, Specific Title"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
description: "Your main point in one sentence"
tags: ["relevant", "tags"]
categories: ["insights"]
author: "Martin Hinshelwood"
---
```

## Avoid

- Academic hedging ("it could be argued that...")
- Restating common wisdom without adding new perspective
- Lists without context (not just "10 tips" - explain why)
- Ending without a clear takeaway
- Corporate safe-speak that offends no one and helps no one

If you're not willing to defend the position in the comments, don't publish it.
