Outcome pages describe the measurable results and business value clients achieve. Focus on transformation and tangible impact, not process descriptions.

## Content Requirements

Each outcome page must:
- **State the outcome clearly**: What specific results do clients achieve?
- **Quantify when possible**: Use metrics, percentages, time frames
- **Show the path**: How do clients get from current state to this outcome?
- **Connect to business value**: Why does this outcome matter to the business?

## Structure

1. **Outcome statement**: The main result (the page title)
2. **What this means**: Concrete examples of this outcome in practice
3. **Key indicators**: How you measure and track this outcome
4. **The journey**: Major phases clients go through to achieve this
5. **Business impact**: Connection to revenue, efficiency, quality, or morale

## Writing Standards

- Lead with results, not methodology.
- Use client language, not consultant speak. "Faster releases" not "accelerated delivery cadence."
- Provide real metrics from past engagements (anonymized if needed).
- Be honest about timelines. "This takes 3-6 months" is better than vague "we'll work together to..."
- Link to relevant case studies that demonstrate this outcome.

## Front Matter Requirements

```yaml
---
title: "Clear Outcome Description"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
description: "One sentence describing the business impact"
tags: ["relevant", "tags"]
categories: ["outcomes"]
---
```

## Examples of Good vs. Bad Outcome Descriptions

**Bad**: "Improved agility and responsiveness"
**Good**: "Deploy to production 10x per day with 60% fewer defects"

**Bad**: "Enhanced team collaboration"
**Good**: "Cross-functional teams resolve incidents in under 2 hours"

**Bad**: "Modern engineering practices"
**Good**: "Automated testing catches 85% of bugs before production"

## Avoid

- Vague transformation promises
- Outcomes that can't be measured or verified
- Process outputs masquerading as outcomes ("implemented Scrum" is not an outcome)
- Ignoring the effort required
- Overselling what's achievable

If you can't point to multiple clients who've achieved this outcome working with you, don't claim it.
