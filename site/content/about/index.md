## I help engineering leaders remove delivery constraints

I work with CTOs, Heads of Engineering, and senior technical leaders who are accountable for delivery outcomes but constrained by legacy systems of work, fragmented tooling, and inconsistent execution.

My role is not to “do DevOps for you”.

My role is to **strengthen your organisation’s ability to deliver software reliably, predictably, and at speed**, without creating dependency on consultants.

---

## What clients engage me to achieve

Clients typically engage me when they need to:

- Reduce lead time and improve delivery predictability  
- Modernise legacy Azure DevOps or GitHub environments without disruption  
- Align engineering execution with strategic objectives and OKRs  
- Increase throughput without burning out teams  
- Establish clear engineering standards that scale  
- Introduce AI-enabled engineering practices safely and pragmatically  

The outcome is **stronger flow, clearer signals, and leadership confidence in delivery**.

---

## How I work

I operate as an **engineering excellence leadership partner**, not an embedded contractor.

My work focuses on:

- Revealing and addressing delivery constraints in your system of work  
- Designing product-aligned operating models that support flow  
- Enabling maintainability, testability, observability, and automation  
- Establishing evidence-based measures that leadership can trust  
- Coaching leaders and senior engineers to sustain improvement internally  

This creates **capability uplift**, not temporary acceleration.

## Why organisations trust me

I bring over **20 years of hands-on engineering and transformation experience** across global enterprises, financial services, technology firms, and scale-ups.

I am a **17-time Microsoft MVP (DevOps & GitHub)** and a long-standing **Professional Scrum Trainer and Professional Kanban Trainer**, with deep experience in Azure DevOps, GitHub, CI/CD, platform engineering, and operating-model design.

I have led and advised transformations at organisations including Microsoft, global financial institutions, and complex regulated environments, always with a focus on **execution discipline and measurable outcomes**.

---

## What makes this different

Most transformations fail because they focus on frameworks, tools, or ceremonies.

My work focuses on **how work actually flows**, how decisions are made, and how engineering systems behave under real pressure.

That is where predictability, speed, and quality are either enabled or constrained.

---

## When this is a fit

This is a fit if:

- You are accountable for delivery outcomes, not just activity  
- You want measurable improvement, not methodology adoption  
- You value strong engineering judgment over dogma  
- You want your organisation to get better after I leave  

If you are looking for a vendor to “run DevOps for you”, this is not a fit.

## Credentials (for those who care)

- 17× Microsoft MVP (DevOps & GitHub)  
- Professional Scrum Trainer (PSM III, PSPO III)  
- Professional Kanban Trainer
- Author and long-time engineering thought leader  
- Founder of Naked Agility

## Next step

If delivery predictability, flow, or engineering confidence are limiting your organisation’s performance, the next step is a short conversation to determine whether there is a meaningful constraint worth addressing.

No sales theatre. No obligation.
