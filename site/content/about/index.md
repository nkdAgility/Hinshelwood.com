**I help engineering leaders remove delivery constraints**

I work with CTOs, Heads of Engineering, and senior technical leaders who are accountable for delivery outcomes but constrained by legacy systems of work, fragmented tooling, and inconsistent execution.

My role is not to “do DevOps for you”.

My role is to **strengthen your organisation’s ability to deliver software reliably, predictably, and at speed**, without creating dependency on consultants.


## What clients engage me to achieve

Clients typically engage me when they need to:

- Reduce lead time and improve delivery predictability  
- Modernise legacy Azure DevOps or GitHub environments without disruption  
- Align engineering execution with strategic objectives and OKRs  
- Increase throughput without burning out teams  
- Establish clear engineering standards that scale  
- Introduce AI-enabled engineering practices safely and pragmatically  

The outcome is **stronger flow, clearer signals, and leadership confidence in delivery**.

## How I work

I operate as an **engineering excellence leadership partner**, not an embedded contractor.

My work focuses on:

- Revealing and addressing delivery constraints in your system of work  
- Designing product-aligned operating models that support flow  
- Enabling maintainability, testability, observability, and automation  
- Establishing evidence-based measures that leadership can trust  
- Coaching leaders and senior engineers to sustain improvement internally  

This creates **capability uplift**, not temporary acceleration.

## Why organisations trust me

I bring over **20 years of hands-on engineering and enablement experience** across global enterprises, financial services, technology firms, and scale-ups.

I am a **17-time Microsoft MVP (DevOps & GitHub)** and a long-standing **Professional Scrum Trainer and Professional Kanban Trainer**, with deep experience in Azure DevOps, GitHub, CI/CD, platform engineering, and operating-model design.

I have led and advised modernisation at organisations including Microsoft, global financial institutions, and complex regulated environments, always with a focus on **execution discipline and measurable outcomes**.

## What makes this different

Most enablement fails because they focus on frameworks, tools, or ceremonies.

My work focuses on **how work actually flows**, how decisions are made, and how engineering systems behave under real pressure.

That is where predictability, speed, and quality are either enabled or constrained.

## When this is a fit

This is a fit if:

- You are accountable for delivery outcomes, not just activity  
- You want measurable improvement, not methodology adoption  
- You value strong engineering judgment over dogma  
- You want your organisation to get better after I leave  

{{< social-proof id="W72KAYY8" >}}

## When this is NOT a fit

This is not a fit if:

- You want someone to "do DevOps" or "run Agile" for you  
- You need body-shop capacity or staff augmentation  
- You are looking for certification theatre or framework compliance  
- You want reassurance that your current approach is fine  
- You expect guaranteed results without organisational commitment  
- You need a vendor who will avoid uncomfortable conversations about constraints  
- You are seeking a methodology to implement rather than capability to build  

I work with leaders who are prepared to examine their systems honestly and act on what we discover. If that is uncomfortable, this is probably not the right engagement.

## How engagement works

I operate on a **fixed-price, timeboxed model**.

Engagements are structured around defined periods: **1 week, 30 days, or 90 days**.

### Engagement levels

**Supportive** (~1-2 hours/week)  
Light input, asynchronous feedback, occasional check-ins for specific challenges.

**Regular** (~6-8 hours/week)  
Regular reviews, pairing sessions, shaping delivery direction and execution practices.

**Deep** (~14-16 hours/week)  
Deep collaboration, hands-on stakeholder engagement, platform and operating-model design.

I don't track hours. The focus is on removing constraints and delivering measurable improvement within the agreed timebox.

### Pricing and terms

Fees are structured around engagement level and duration. You retain a percentage of my capacity, not individual hours.

**Indicative fee ranges:**

| Engagement Level | 1 Week | 30 Days | 90 Days |
|-----------------|--------|---------|---------|
| **Supportive** (~5% capacity) | £2,500–£4,000 | £8,000–£12,000 | £20,000–£30,000 |
| **Regular** (~25% capacity) | £6,000–£9,000 | £18,000–£28,000 | £45,000–£70,000 |
| **Deep** (~50% capacity) | £10,000–£15,000 | £32,000–£48,000 | £80,000–£120,000 |

Fees vary based on complexity, urgency, location requirements, and purchasing power parity adjustments for your region. UK IR35-risky contracts incur an additional 40% surcharge.

**Payment terms:**
- 50% due upon acceptance  
- 50% due 15 days after engagement start  
- 5% discount available for full payment upfront  

**Satisfaction guarantee:** If the engagement doesn't meet agreed standards, I refund your fee.

Engagements are non-cancellable but may be rescheduled without penalty.
