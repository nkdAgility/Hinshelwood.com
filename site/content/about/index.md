**I help engineering leaders ship faster without increasing risk**

I work with CTOs, Heads of Engineering, senior technical leaders, and their teams who are accountable for delivery outcomes but slowed by legacy systems, fragmented tooling, and inconsistent execution.

My role is not to "do DevOps for you".

My role is to help your organization deliver software reliably, predictably, and at speed, without creating dependency on consultants.

## What clients engage me to achieve

Clients typically engage me when they need to:

- Ship features in weeks instead of months
- Modernise legacy Azure DevOps or GitHub environments without disruption
- Engineering delivers what the business needs when it's needed
- Teams deliver more without working longer hours
- Engineering standards are clear and enforced consistently
- AI improves engineering productivity without creating new risks

The outcome is faster delivery, better visibility, and confidence in your engineering organization.

## How I work

I work as an engineering leadership partner, not an embedded contractor.

My work focuses on:

- Finding what's blocking delivery and fixing it
- Designing how engineering teams are organized and funded
- Making code easier to maintain, test, monitor, and deploy
- Creating metrics leadership can trust
- Teaching leaders and senior engineers to sustain improvement without me

This builds lasting capability, not temporary speed.

## Why organizations trust me

I bring over **20 years of hands-on engineering and consulting experience** across global enterprises, financial services, technology firms, and scale-ups.

I am a **17-time Microsoft MVP (DevOps & GitHub)**, a long-standing **Professional Scrum Trainer**, **Professional Kanban Trainer**, and a **Kendall Project Certified Partner** specializing in AI context curation and problem identification. I have deep experience in Azure DevOps, GitHub, CI/CD, platform engineering, how organizations structure engineering work, and helping organizations apply AI effectively through proper context and problem framing.

I have led and advised modernization at organizations including Microsoft, global financial institutions, and complex regulated environments, always focused on measurable outcomes.

## What makes this different

Most consulting fails because it focuses on frameworks, tools, or ceremonies.

I focus on how work actually flows, how decisions are made, and how engineering systems behave under real pressure.

That is where predictability, speed, and quality either happen or break down.

## When this is a fit

This is a fit if:

- You are accountable for delivery outcomes, not just activity
- You want measurable improvement, not methodology adoption
- You value strong engineering judgment over dogma
- You want your organization to get better after I leave

{{< social-proof id="W72KAYY8" >}}

## When this is NOT a fit

This is not a fit if:

- You want someone to "do DevOps" or "run Agile" for you
- You need body-shop capacity or staff augmentation
- You are looking for certification theatre or framework compliance
- You want reassurance that your current approach is fine
- You expect guaranteed results without organizational commitment
- You need a vendor who will avoid uncomfortable conversations about what's broken
- You are seeking a methodology to implement rather than problems to solve

I work with leaders who are prepared to examine their systems honestly and act on what we discover. If that is uncomfortable, this is probably not the right engagement.

## How engagement works

I operate on a **fixed-price, timeboxed model**.

Engagements are structured around defined periods: **1 week, 30 days, or 90 days**.

### Engagement levels

**Supportive** (~1-2 hours/week)  
Light input, asynchronous feedback, occasional check-ins for specific challenges.

**Regular** (~6-8 hours/week)  
Regular reviews, pairing sessions, shaping delivery direction and execution practices.

**Deep** (~14-16 hours/week)  
Deep collaboration, working directly with engineering and product leaders, platform and operating-model design.

I don't track hours. The focus is on fixing what's blocking you and delivering measurable improvement within the agreed timebox.

Fees vary based on complexity, urgency, location requirements, and purchasing power parity adjustments for your region. UK IR35-risky contracts incur an additional 40% surcharge.

**Payment terms:**

- 50% due upon acceptance
- 50% due 15 days after engagement start
- 5% discount available for full payment upfront

**Satisfaction guarantee:** If the engagement doesn't meet agreed standards, I refund your fee.

Engagements are non-cancellable but may be rescheduled without penalty.
