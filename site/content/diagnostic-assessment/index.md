Before engaging advisory support, leaders need clarity on three questions:

1. Is this problem systematic or symptomatic?
2. Is the constraint addressable without massive disruption?
3. Is this the right time to act?

This assessment answers those questions.

## What Happens

A 30-minute video conversation where:

- You describe what you're seeing and feeling
- I ask diagnostic questions to identify root constraints
- You leave with clear perspective

No pitch. No obligation. Just clarity.

## Who This Is For

This conversation makes sense if you're seeing:

- **The same problems keep happening** no matter who you hire or what processes you change
- **You can restructure the organization**, not just adjust workflows
- **You have budget available** and the problem is significant enough to warrant spending it
- **Delivery capability is holding back growth** or competitive advantage

If you're exploring options or need evidence to build an internal case, this conversation helps you determine whether further investigation is warranted.

## What You Leave With

After the assessment, you'll have:

- **Clarity**: Is your problem in the operating model, organizational structure, or technical architecture?
- **Feasibility**: Can this be addressed without massive disruption?
- **Recommendation**: Is this the right constraint to tackle now, or should you address something else first?

If the constraint is addressable and timely, we discuss what engagement would involve. If not, I'll tell you.
