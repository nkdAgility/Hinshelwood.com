Before engaging advisory support, leaders need clarity on three questions:

1. Is this problem systematic or symptomatic?
2. Is the constraint addressable without massive disruption?
3. Is this the right time to act?

This assessment answers those questions.

## What Happens

A 30-minute video conversation where:

- You describe what you're seeing (missed commitments, rising costs, stalled initiatives)
- I ask diagnostic questions to identify root constraints
- You leave with clear perspective on whether your constraint is structural and addressable

No pitch. No obligation. Just clarity.

## Who This Is For

This conversation makes sense if you're seeing:

- **Recurring patterns** that don't resolve despite changing people or processes
- **Leadership authority** to make structural decisions (not just process changes)
- **Budget context** where intervention cost is proportional to constraint cost
- **Strategic pressure** where current delivery capability limits growth or competitive position

If you're exploring options or need evidence to build an internal case, this conversation helps you determine whether further investigation is warranted.

## What You Leave With

After the assessment, you'll have:

- **Constraint clarity**: Is your problem in the operating model, organizational structure, or technical architecture?
- **Intervention feasibility**: Can this be addressed without massive disruption?
- **Timing recommendation**: Is this the right constraint to tackle now, or should you address something else first?

If the constraint is addressable and timely, we discuss what engagement would involve. If not, I'll tell you.
