I help organisations improve delivery and outcomes through technical leadership and engineering excellence.

My work focuses on first principles and measurable results, using evidence to understand what is really happening in your system of work. I work directly with leaders and teams to remove friction, improve flow, and enable reliable delivery of valuable software.

I support organisations in evolving their way of working beyond rigid processes, towards a co-adaptive flow of value that responds to real conditions rather than frameworks alone.

DevOps, Agile, Lean, and AI are treated as enablers of delivery, not ends in themselves. My background in Scrum and Kanban, combined with deep technical experience across Azure DevOps, GitHub, .NET, Azure, and AI, allows me to help organisations make better decisions, strengthen delivery capability, and achieve outcomes that matter.
