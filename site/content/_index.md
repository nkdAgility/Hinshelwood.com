I help engineering leaders restore predictability, reduce operational cost, and regain leverage—without creating dependency on consultants.

**This is for CTOs and engineering leaders accountable for delivery outcomes, not project managers seeking process compliance.**

My work focuses on first principles and measurable results, using evidence to understand what is really happening in your system of work. I work directly with leaders and teams to remove friction, improve flow, and enable reliable delivery of valuable software.

I support organisations in evolving their operating model beyond rigid processes, towards a co-adaptive flow of value that responds to real conditions rather than frameworks alone.

DevOps, Agile, Lean, and AI are treated as enablers of delivery, not ends in themselves. My background in Scrum and Kanban, combined with deep technical experience across Azure DevOps, GitHub, .NET, Azure, and AI, allows me to help organisations make better decisions, strengthen delivery capability, and achieve outcomes that matter.
