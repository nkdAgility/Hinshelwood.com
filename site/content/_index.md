I'm Martin Hinshelwood. I help CTOs and engineering leaders achieve delivery and outcomes through technical leadership.

Your teams are capable. Your people are smart. But delivery is unpredictable, costs are rising, and technical decisions keep creating problems instead of solving them. This is a systems constraint, not a people problem.

**I work with CTOs and engineering leaders accountable for delivery outcomes, not project managers seeking process compliance.**

I identify the constraint preventing delivery, then work with your leaders and teams to remove it. You get measurable improvements in cycle time, predictability, and engineering leverage. Your organization builds the capability to sustain results after I leave.

## What You Get

**Evidence-based diagnosis**: I find the actual constraint limiting delivery, not the symptoms everyone complains about.

**Technical leadership**: I work directly with engineering leaders to make better architectural, process, and organizational decisions that compound over time.

**Measurable outcomes**: Shorter cycle times, lower defect rates, reduced coordination cost, reliable delivery of committed features.

**Sustained capability**: Your teams learn to diagnose and solve delivery problems without ongoing consultant dependency.

## Investment

Typical engagements run 10 to 90 days and are structured around measurable outcomes rather than time.

**What This Prevents**: A single delayed quarter costs £2M-£5M in missed revenue. Failed platform migrations cost £500K-£2M in abandoned work. Poor technical decisions compound quarterly, accumulating 15-25% additional operational cost year on year. One prevented failure pays for the engagement multiple times over.

**What This Enables**: Restored predictability lets you commit to revenue forecasts with confidence. Reduced coordination cost frees engineering capacity for value work. Better technical decisions reduce future cost and increase strategic optionality. The return shows up in shorter cycle times, lower defect rates, and reliable delivery of committed features.

**Cost of Inaction**: Organizations that delay face 20-40% of engineering capacity lost to coordination overhead, quarterly targets missed by 15-30%, technical debt accumulating at 3-5x feature development rate, and 40-60% of strategic initiatives failing to deliver expected value.
