I help engineering leaders restore predictability, reduce operational cost, and regain leverage—without creating dependency on consultants.

**This is for CTOs and engineering leaders accountable for delivery outcomes, not project managers seeking process compliance.**

My work focuses on first principles and measurable results, using evidence to understand what is really happening in your system of work. I work directly with leaders and teams to remove friction, improve flow, and enable reliable delivery of valuable software.

I support organisations in evolving their operating model beyond rigid processes, towards a co-adaptive flow of value that responds to real conditions rather than frameworks alone.

DevOps, Agile, Lean, and AI are treated as enablers of delivery, not ends in themselves. My background in Scrum and Kanban, combined with deep technical experience across Azure DevOps, GitHub, .NET, Azure, and AI, allows me to help organisations make better decisions, strengthen delivery capability, and achieve outcomes that matter.

## Investment

Typical diagnostic and advisory engagements are from 10 to 90-day engagements and are structured around measurable outcomes rather than time.

### What This Prevents

A single delayed quarter typically costs organisations £2M-£5M in missed revenue, depending on scale. Failed platform migrations cost £500K-£2M in abandoned work. Poor technical decisions compound quarterly, accumulating 15-25% additional operational cost year on year.

One prevented failure pays for the engagement multiple times over.

### What This Enables

Restored predictability lets you commit to revenue forecasts with confidence. Reduced coordination cost frees engineering capacity for value work. Better technical decisions reduce future cost and increase strategic optionality.

The return shows up in shorter cycle times, lower defect rates, and reliable delivery of committed features.

### Cost of Not Acting

Organisations that delay addressing systemic delivery constraints face:

- 20-40% of engineering capacity lost to coordination overhead and rework
- Quarterly revenue targets missed by 15-30% due to unpredictable delivery
- Technical debt accumulating at 3-5x the rate of feature development
- 40-60% of strategic initiatives failing to deliver expected value due to decisions made without evidence

The cost of continuing with a system that does not reliably deliver is measurably higher than the cost of fixing it.
